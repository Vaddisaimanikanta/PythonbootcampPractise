1.Naming_convention?
   A naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.
   Reasons for using Naming_convention:
     1.To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;[1]
     2.To enable code reviews to focus on issues more important than syntax and naming standards.
     3.To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.
   Rules to follow:
     1.It should not start with any number,special character or spaces 
     2.It should start with char or _ .
     3.Declearing should be very meaningful 
  Ex:-
       @A=10 or 2=4 invalid
       A=10 or _A=4 valid 
       A=2*2 (It is valid but we need specify it clear ex:- Multiplication_of_twonumbers/product/Multiple)
2.Mutable and Immutabl?
       Mutable:	Data type whose values can be changed after creation.Ex:	List, Dictionaries, Set
       Memory Retains the same memory location even after the content is modified.  
       Immutable:Data types whose values canâ€™t be changed or altered.
       Memory Any modification results in a new object and new memory location
3.List:List are used to store different types of datastructure.It acts as a container to store differnt values
      list are opened and enclosed with square brackets []
      list=[10,"mainkanta",True,2.3]
      List Methods:
         .append() ->it will add element to the last of the list
         .remove() -> Remove a given element from the list
         .index()  ->Returns the lowest index where the element appears.
         .count() ->These methods count the elements.
         .pop()   ->Removes and returns the last value from the List or the given index value.
